# MEDS Snow Today Capstone Group Project R Shiny App

The MEDS Capstone group project deliverables are visualized within this R Shiny application. This application hosts pages displaying snow data visualizations, snow science glossary, and links to Snow Today's monthly news letters, SPIReS data, and tutorials based in python. 

## Motivation

The MEDS Snow Today Capstone group created this R Shiny app to provide background details on the capstone project team and project goals, display project deliverables related to interactive snow condition data charts and maps, and house links to Snow Today data, snow science reference materials, and links to tutorials on processing SPIReS data in Python.

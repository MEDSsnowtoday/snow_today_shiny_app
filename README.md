# MEDS Snow Today Capstone Project R Shiny App

This Shiny app was developed to showcase our project's contributions towards a more open source workflow for Snow Today data and increase the usability of the Snow Today website. The web application presents potential features for the new Snow Today website, interactive visualizations, and tutorials. It also presents documentation on snow science, links to Snow Today monthly newsletters, information on the data sources including metadata, MEDS capstone project background, and team bios.

## Motivation

The MEDS Snow Today Capstone group created this R Shiny app to provide background details on the capstone project team and project goals, display project deliverables related to interactive snow condition data charts and maps, and house links to Snow Today data, snow science reference materials, and links to tutorials on processing SPIReS data in Python. Interactive visualizations presented on the Shiny app are for the Sierra Nevada region of the Western United States.
